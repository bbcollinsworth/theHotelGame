# <i><strong>Room 1206</strong></i>

<i><strong>Room 1206</strong></i> is an exploratory narrative game in which you play a hotel housekeeper. Every day you clean the same room. As you complete your daily tasks, you encounter the signs and remnants of the guests who are staying there. Personal items, photographs, "garbage" left behind. Some mundane; some hinting at secrets, scandals, the triumphs and failures of human life. How far will you go to uncover the stories of these guests?

This game was inspired by <i>Being in the World</i>. Created as first-person exploration game, it borrows from many of the phenomenological concepts put forth by Martin Heidegger. We sought to make the objects become “ready at hand” or to disappear in the shadow of the narrative experience they are expressing. The objects are merely a conduit for their real purpose: to unveil the lives of the people temporarily inhabiting the hotel room. Furthermore, we also drew from <i>The Allegory of the Cave</i>, choosing to create our own cave in the form of a hotel room that the player never actually leaves. Instead, their understanding of the world beyond comes only from the clues they find and the view through the window. Our goal was to create a world lens that would draw the player into the rules and stories taking place in the hotel room, completely isolated from anything outside of that world.
